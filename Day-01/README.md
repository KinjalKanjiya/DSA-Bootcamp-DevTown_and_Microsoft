## Data structure:
Container in which we store different kinds of data together in unified manner depending upon requirements.

## How Data Structure varies from Data Type:
We already have learned about data structure. Many times, what happens is that people get confused between data type and data structure. So let’s see a few differences between data type and data structure to make it clear.

## Classification of Data Structure: 
Data structure has many different uses in our daily life. There are many different data structures that are used to solve different mathematical and logical problems. By using data structure, one can organize and process a very large amount of data in a relatively short period. Let’s look at different data structures that are used in different situations.

- <b>Linear data structure:</b><br> Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
  - <b>Static data structure:</b> <br> Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
An example of this data structure is an array.
  - <b>Dynamic data structure:</b> <br> In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.
- <b> Non-linear data structure: </b> <br> Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.
